Most of the Rails websites we deploy have a similar configs.
At Newfangled we employ Apache rewrite rules to keep our page caching clean and simple. The regular expression for defining the rewrite rule can be a bit hard to remember, and we are constantly tweaking it. 

Tested and deployed on Apache 2.2+ on CentOS

h2. ErrorDocument

A lot of the websites we write are replacing php sites. Consequently there are legacy urls with the .php extension. Assuming that php is installed on the server, accessing a legacy php url will bypass Rails and render the default "no file of  name". 

* This isn't useful to the user.
* It's not pretty, as Apache will render a bare page. 
* Users will think they have "broken the website".

Via ErrorDocument we can render a "smarter page". 
This assumes that you have routes in your Rails app to handle 404 and 403 errors.
Since we are now back in the Rails stack, we can be more useful to what we display to users. Ie: offer search results, or at the very least the page that is rendered will be consistent with the rest of the site.

After editing the config file, you should test it with Apaches configtest utiltiy.

run "apachectl -t"

If everything is fine it will return "Syntax OK". If not it will return information on the errors it found. 


This will only parse the active config file used by Apache. If you want it to parse a config file that your editing elsewhere on your machine you can eitherâ€¦
* move the file into the config directory. /etc/httpd/config.d, or /etc/apache2/config.d
* Tell Apache to look at your alternate config file. It will then parse your config file before accepting it

	"apachectl -f /path/to/your/file
